#Superstitious Pidgeons Trainer

Pidgeons are smart enough to remember what they did when they got their reward so they are repeating their actions in order to get rewarded again.

Unfortunately, they are all being rewarded on regular intervals so their actions have nothing to do with them being rewarded or not. That makes them intelligent just enough to be superstitious.

Use the sliders to change award frequency, memory capacity of pidgeons and how likely they are to get distracted and learn new sequence of moves.
